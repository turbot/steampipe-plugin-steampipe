# Steampipe

The Steampipe plugin is used to query Steampipe components, such as the available plugins in the Steampipe hub.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

This plugin currently requires no authentication as it only queries public endpoints.

For example:

```sql
select
  name,
  update_time
from
  steampipe_registry_plugin
```

```
